# AWS Cognito Login with Web Authentication in SwiftUI

This project demonstrates how to integrate AWS Cognito authentication with web-based login into a SwiftUI application using AWS auth api.
Your mobile app users can sign in through social identity providers (IdP) like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. With the built-in hosted web UI, Amazon Cognito provides token handling and management for all authenticated users.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need the following:

A user pool with an app client and a user pool domain. For more information, see [Create a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-as-user-directory.html).

- Xcode (latest version)
- An active Google developer app for google login.
- An active AppStore connect app & Bundle ID from apple developer.
- An active Facebook developer app for facebook login. 

See more to configure proper [User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-social-idp.html)

# Configuration üë©üèæ‚Äçüî¨

## Configure Federated Signin (google, facebook, apple and others)
Follow step by step to configure user pool and get all necessary keys and IDs from there for more information about setup [see here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-social-idp.html)

```swift

    user_pool_domain = "<your_user_pool_domain>"
    redirect_uri = "<your_redirect_uri>"
    client_id = "<your_user_pool_client_id>"
    client_secret = "<your_user_pool_client_secret>"
    app_scope =  "<your_app_scope>" // eg: "aws.cognito.signin.user.admin+email+openid+phone+profile"
    
```

# Usage üë©üèæ‚Äçüî¨

In order to use this into your project need to drag & drop Helper folder files into your project and write the code into your contentview file like below.

```swift

struct ContentView: View {
    
    @ObservedObject var viewModel = WebViewModel()
    @State var isSheetOpen = false
    
    var body: some View {
                ----
                .sheet(isPresented: $isSheetOpen,onDismiss: {
                    isSheetOpen = false
                }) {
                    App_WebView(loadingUrl: self.getUrlFor(type: self.loginType), viewModel: viewModel)
                }
              ----
            }
        }

```

## Helper Method

To use web page url based on login type.


```swift

        func getUrlFor(type: String)->String {
        var webUrl = ""
        if type == LoginType.Google.rawValue {
            let identity_provider = "Google"
            webUrl = "\(CognitoKeys().user_pool_domain)/oauth2/authorize?identity_provider=\(identity_provider)&client_id=\(CognitoKeys().client_id)&response_type=code&scope=\(CognitoKeys().app_scope)&redirect_uri=\(CognitoKeys().redirect_uri)"
        } else if type == LoginType.SignInWithApple.rawValue {
            let identity_provider = "SignInWithApple"
            webUrl = "\(CognitoKeys().user_pool_domain)/oauth2/authorize?identity_provider=\(identity_provider)&client_id=\(CognitoKeys().client_id)&response_type=code&scope=\(CognitoKeys().app_scope)&redirect_uri=\(CognitoKeys().redirect_uri)"
        } else if type == LoginType.UserSignUp.rawValue {
            let identity_provider = ""
            webUrl = "\(CognitoKeys().user_pool_domain)/signup?identity_provider=\(identity_provider)&client_id=\(CognitoKeys().client_id)&response_type=code&redirect_uri=\(CognitoKeys().redirect_uri)"
            
        } else if type == LoginType.UserSignIn.rawValue {
            webUrl = "\(CognitoKeys().user_pool_domain)/login?client_id=\(CognitoKeys().client_id)&response_type=code&scope=\(CognitoKeys().app_scope)&redirect_uri=\(CognitoKeys().redirect_uri)"
        }
        return webUrl
    }
    

```

Now that you have all set to login and get user detail directly into your view.
